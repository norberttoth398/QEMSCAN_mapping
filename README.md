# QEMSCAN_mapping

The data used in the notebook (note: it's 2.2GB but it's the raw output from QEMSCAN) for demonstration purposes can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZA3-gKlL79qDbgo5hhCP7GQInKgg8_86?usp=sharing .

The Jupyter notebook provides a running commentary of the operations so no further description is provided here. Everything necessary for elemental mapping is provided (and perhaps a little extra...).

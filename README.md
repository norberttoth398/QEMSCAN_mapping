# QEMSCAN_mapping

The data used in the notebook (note: it's 2.2GB but it's the raw output from QEMSCAN) for demonstration purposes can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZA3-gKlL79qDbgo5hhCP7GQInKgg8_86?usp=sharing .

The Jupyter notebook provides a running commentary of the operations so no further description is provided here. Everything necessary for elemental mapping is provided (and perhaps a little extra...).

The folder named "Optional" contains the whole set of the QEMSCAN code as of 16/10/2021, further explanation and description of this can be provided if requested, but requires writing up at the moment... The docstrings in the file are hoped to provide enough detail, but it is not envisaged to be used.
